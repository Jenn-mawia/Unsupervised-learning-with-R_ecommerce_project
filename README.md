# Description
This is project consisted of two parts which entailed:

- Supervised learning and 

- Unsupervised learning

**Background Information**
- Part 1: **Advertising project**
The data is from a Kenyan entrepreneur who has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. Data was collected previously by the entrepreneur by running ads similar to a related course as the one she intends to advertise. The main objective of this project was to: **identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads**.

It was found that most individuals that are more likely to click on her ads were users with a low income and low daily internet usage while the prime time for ad clicking was 9am.

- Part 2: **E-commerce project**
Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

It was established that:

- Most users visiting the ecommerce site are not new visitors 
- The month of May has the highest number of visits to the site, followed by November while February had the least number of visits. May however, does not result in a higher revenue as November does. It could be that more users make a lot of purchase to gift their loved ones over festivities such as Thanksgiving holiday, Christmas holiday, New year’s holiday
